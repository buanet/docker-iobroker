# ioBroker for Docker
Source: https://github.com/buanet/docker-iobroker

IoBroker for Docker is an Dockerimage for ioBroker (http://iobroker.net) smarthome software. 

It is originally made for, and tested on a Synology Disk Station 1515+ with DSM 6 and Docker-package installed. But it should also work on other systems with Docker installed!

Version 4 now supports running the Image in Docker on the following architectures: amd64, armv7hf, aarch64.
Feel free to ask for more architectures by opening an github-issue. 

## Important

The new v4 comes again with a new major node-version (node10)!
If you are updating an existing installation you have to perform some additional steps inside ioBroker!
After upgrading your iobroker-container you have to call "reinstall.sh" for recompiling your installation for the use with node10!

```bash
# update the $CONTAINER_ID below!
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID node ./reinstall.js
```

For Details see official ioBroker-documentation (https://www.iobroker.net/#en/documentation/install/updatenode.md). Make backup first!

## Installation & usage

A detailed tutorial (german, based on v3.0.0) can be found here: [https://buanet.de](https://buanet.de/2019/05/iobroker-unter-docker-auf-der-synology-diskstation-v3/). Please notice that the old tutorial is outdated and does no longer work!

For discussion and support please visit [ioBroker-forum-thread](http://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5089) or use the comments section at the linked tutorial. Please do not contact me directly for any support-reasons. Every support-question should be answered in a public place. Thank you.

## Special settings and features

The following will give a short overview.

### Environment variables

Since v3 is possible to set some environment variables to configure a new container. 

|env|value|description|
|---|---|---|
|PACKAGES|package1 package2 package2|seperateed by whitespace; will install the listed packages on startup<br>(be paitient, this may take some time!)|
|AVAHI|true|will install and activate avahi-daemon for supporting yahka-adapter|
|LANGUAGE|de_DE:de|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE:de, en_US:en|
|LANG|de_DE.UTF-8|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE.UTF-8, en_US.UTF-8|
|LC_ALL|de_DE|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE.UTF-8, en_US.UTF-8|
|TZ|Europe/Berlin|all valid Linux-timezones|
|SETUID|1000|for security reasons it might be useful to specify the uid of the containers iobroker user to match an existing user on the docker host|
|SETGID|1000|for security reasons it might be useful to specify the gid of the containers iobroker user to match an existing group on the docker host|
|ZWAVE|false|will install openzwave to support zwave-adapter|

### Mounting Folder/ Volume

It is now possible to mount an empty folder to /opt/iobroker during first startup of the container. The Startupscript will check this folder and restore content if it is empty.

It is absolutely recommended to use a mounted folder or persistent volume for /opt/iobroker folder!

This also works with mounting a folder containing an existing ioBroker-installation (e.g. when moving an existing installation to docker). 

### Permission Fixer

After some issues with permissions related to the use of a dedicated user for ioBroker, I added some code for fixing permissions on container startup. This might take a few minutes on first startup. Please take a look at the logs and be patient!
